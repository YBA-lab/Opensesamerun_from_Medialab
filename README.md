# Opensesamerun_from_Medialab
A simple script for getting Opensesame (http://osdoc.cogsci.nl/) to read and use Medialab's (http://empirisoft.com/) SubjectID, using a Batch file and a txt file where the researcher needs to set some variables (e.g. Study path, Data path, etc.).
The script can run from any directory, as long as study.txt is in the same folder. 

Useful in experiment where Opensesame is used as a part of the experiment, perhaps only to run a certain specific task (e.g., Implicit Association Test - IAT), but Medialab is used to administer other parts of the study (e.g., explcit attitude measures/questionnaires).

# not stupid-proof.
# minimal error checking - if any.
review the code and txt file for additional comments, and usage.
